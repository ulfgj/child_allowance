child_allowance
===
system for keeping track of my 3 kid's allowances & expenses.


### TODO

soon

* set up up sys.args for adding transactions
* child creation (not the fun kind...)
    - perhaps with option -c, --create ?

later

* better command-line interface for adding transactions
* automatically add amount for each period child receives allowance
